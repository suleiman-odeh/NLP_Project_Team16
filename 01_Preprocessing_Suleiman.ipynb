            "They talked about . [] Excuse me. I wasn't there. []No, that's a legitimate question, and the question is, why now? Why do I think something positive can happen? Well, first of all, the legislative process takes awhile in the United States. I don't know about Mexico, Mr. President, but sometimes legislators, you know, debate issues for awhile before a solution can be achieved.And we had a very—by the way, we haven't had a serious debate on migration until recently. A law was passed in 1986, and then there really wasn't a serious debate until pretty much starting after the year 2000, if my memory serves me well. I've always known this is an important issue because I happened to have been the Governor of Texas. And so I'm very comfortable about discussing the issue and have elevated the issue over the past years. And Members of Congress have taken the issue very seriously, but it's hard to get legislation out of the Congress on a very complex issue.A lot of Americans were deeply concerned that the United States was not enforcing our laws. They felt like there wasn't a commitment to the rule of law. Over the past year, I believe we have shown the American people that there is a strong commitment to the rule of law. And I think Members of Congress are now feeling more comfortable that the country is committed to rule of law, which then makes some more openminded to my argument, which is that if we can have migration reform, it will make it less likely somebody will feel like they have to sneak across our border, and, therefore, take pressure off the border. In other words, security for the country, border security, will be enhanced by a good migration law, and then it will make it easier for us to focus our assets on drugs, terrorists, criminals, and guns moving both ways.I believe—I feel pretty good about it. I don't want to predict legislative successes. But I can tell you my mood, and my mood is optimistic because the mood in the Congress seems like it has changed from skepticism last year to knowledge that getting a comprehensive bill will be in the Nation's interests.Secondly, I'm optimistic because Republicans in the Senate are working with Democrats in the Senate. We're facilitating that work. The administration is very much involved with helping the Senators find common ground, to the point where we can move a bill as quickly as possible out of the Senate so it gets to the House of Representatives.I'm not a betting man. I don't like to bet, because when I do, I usually lose. But I'm an optimistic man, in this case, about getting comprehensive reform, and a bill is in the interests of both countries. I met with former President Vicente Fox, whom I like, and we have a good friendship. We belong to the same party. I invited him to lunch; we talked for quite a while, talked about matters in a very constructive fashion. And he congratulated us for the work that we've done during these first 100 days. He also said that he had the will to collaborate and cooperate in a respectful fashion with the government for the benefit of Mexicans.I have also met with other former Presidents, and I'm sure that I will continue to meet with President Fox in the future throughout my administration. Here it comes.\n",

            "The United States has agreed to—with us that the peace process will be led by Afghans, and Afghans will be—will continue this process, and it will be led by Afghans. And this is obvious for us, and we are thankful for the support. . Afghanistan is still a dangerous place. The way it's going to become less dangerous is by Afghan security forces and Afghan police being capable of keeping law and order and security in the country. And that is not going to happen if foreign forces are continually relied upon for the basic security of Afghanistan.So there are going to be specialized areas where we can cooperate, dealing with some of the most vicious terrorist networks. There's going to be intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism cooperation. And there are going to be specialized areas where we can provide logistical support and training and enabling support.But the fact is, is that unless Afghan soldiers and Afghan police are able to maintain security, at some point, someday, the United States and other coalition forces would leave. And the good news is, what we've seen as we've removed ourselves from combat roles is the Afghan security forces have stepped up. And although they're certainly not as well equipped as coalition forces, they're better equipped than the Taliban. They're better equipped than the Haqqani network.And so with the kind of leadership that President Ghani is showing as a Commander in Chief, with the leadership that's being shown by a growing cadre of military officers up and down the military chain, Afghan forces are proving themselves and discovering that, in fact, when they fight, they can be successful. And we want to stand with them in that process because we are very much invested in your success.So, Mr. President, thank you for an outstanding visit. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.\n",

            "That's a lot of questions there, Jim. [] Do the Italian journalists, by the way, do this—these sort of five-part questions? [] Same thing?[.] I can't say about Italian journalism. [] The—all right, let me try to remember this. In terms of the meeting with His Holiness Pope Francis, we had a wide-ranging discussion. I would say that the largest bulk of the time was discussing two central concerns of his. One is the issues of the poor, the marginalized, those without opportunity, and growing inequality.And those of us as politicians have the task of trying to come up with policies to address issues, but His Holiness has the capacity to open people's eyes and make sure they're seeing that this is an issue. And he's discussed in the past, I think, the dangers of indifference or cynicism when it comes to our ability to reach out to those less fortunate or those locked out of opportunity.And then we spent a lot of time talking about the challenges of conflict and how elusive peace is around the world. There was some specific focus on the Middle East, where His Holiness has a deep interest in the Israeli-Palestinian issue, but also what's happening in Syria, what's happening in Lebanon, and the potential persecution of Christians. And I reaffirmed that it is central to U.S. foreign policy that we protect the interests of religious minorities around the world.But we also touched on regions like Latin America, where there's been tremendous progress in many countries, but there's been less progress in others.I think what—the theme that stitched our conversation together was a belief that in politics and in life, the quality of empathy, the ability to stand in somebody else's shoes and to care for someone even if they don't look like you or talk like you or share your philosophy, that that's critical. It's the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars. It's the lack of empathy that allows us to ignore the homeless on the streets. And obviously, central to my Christian faith is a belief in treating others as they—I'd have them treat me. And what's, I think, created so much love and excitement for His Holiness has been that he seems to live this and shows that joy continuously.In terms of domestic issues, the two issues that we touched on—other than the fact that I invited and urged him to come visit the United States, telling him that people would be overjoyed to see him—was immigration reform. And as someone who came from Latin America, I think he was very mindful of the plight of so many immigrants who are wonderful people, working hard, making contributions, many of their children are U.S. citizens, and yet they still live in the shadows, in many cases have been deported, and are separated from families. I described to him how I felt that there was still an opportunity for us to make this right and get a law passed.And he actually did not touch, in detail, on the Affordable Care Act. In my Cardinal—in my meeting with his Secretary of State, Cardinal Parolin, we discussed briefly the issue of making sure that conscience and religious freedom was observed in the context of applying the law. And I explained to him that most religious organizations are entirely exempt. Religiously affiliated hospitals or universities or NGOs simply have to attest that they have a religious objection, in which case they are not required to provide contraception, although employees of theirs who choose are able to obtain it through the insurance company.And I pledged to continue to dialogue with the U.S. Conference of Bishops to make sure that we can strike the right balance, making sure that not only everybody has health care, but families, and women in particular, are able to enjoy the kind of health care coverage that the ACA offers, but that religious freedom is still observed.\n",

            "So, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I hven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will—there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce—nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces. Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people. And tht's exctly the essge tht hs been sent. President ung. Let e respond to this question concerning the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting trnsltio Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Cn you her, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I' sure tht he ws sying soething very wise nd iportnt, nd we wnted to ke sure tht we ll herd it. President ung. So I would like to dd tht Vietn, together with other TPP countries, hve been king efforts to nrrow differences, to proote coopertion in the spirit of utul understnding nd utul respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness nd understnding nd pying ttention to one nother's legitite interests. And the finliztion of TPP is lso the successful outcoes of ll 12 ebers of the TPP, rther thn ny individul effort. And we re prepred to rtify TPP, nd we stnd redy to ipleent ll the coitents under TPP.\n",

            "Jennifer , I'll be glad to share some of the private conversation with His Holy Father. First, I'll give you an impression. I was talking to a very smart, loving man. And I, you know, after 61⁄2 years of being the President, I've seen some unusual, I've been to some unusual places, and I've met some interesting people. And I was in awe, and it was a moving experience for me.We didn't talk about just war. He did express deep concern about the Christians inside Iraq, that he was concerned that the society that was evolving would not tolerate the Christian religion. And I assured him we're working hard to make sure that they, people lived up to the Constitution, that modern Constitution voted on by the people that would honor people from different walks of life and different attitudes.We talked about a lot of other subjects. We talked about our attempts to help the people in Africa deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and hunger. I reminded him that we made a significant commitment to that end, that about 3 years ago, 50,000 people were getting antiretroviral drugs. Now over 1,100,000 people are getting them, as a result of our initiative on HIV/AIDS, and that I'm going to double that commitment, or ask Congress to double the commitment from 15 billion to 30 billion.I talked to him about our malaria program, about how we intend to reduce malaria by 50 percent in certain countries, and that I'd continue to remind the world of our duty to work together to achieve a major goal, which is to try to eradicate malaria throughout Africa.And I talked to him about our attempts to feed the hungry, and I also reminded him that we've got poor people in our own neighborhood that need to be affected.He talked about immigration. He's watching the immigration debate very closely in America. And I told him I was a person who strongly supports comprehensive immigration reform that, on the one hand, we'll enforce our law; on the other hand, we need to treat people with dignity. And we had a good discussion.\n"

I invited him to lunch; we talked for quite a while, talked about matters in a very constructive fashion. And he congratulated us for the work that we've done during these first 100 days. He also said that he had the will to collaborate and cooperate in a respectful fashion with the government for the benefit of Mexicans.I have also met with other former Presidents, and I'm sure that I will continue to meet with President Fox in the future throughout my administration. Here it comes.\n",

            "The United States has agreed to, with us that the peace process will be led by Afghans, and Afghans will be, will continue this process, and it will be led by Afghans. And this is obvious for us, and we are thankful for the support. . Afghanistan is still a dangerous place. The way it's going to become less dangerous is by Afghan security forces and Afghan police being capable of keeping law and order and security in the country. And that is not going to happen if foreign forces are continually relied upon for the basic security of Afghanistan.So there are going to be specialized areas where we can cooperate, dealing with some of the most vicious terrorist networks. There's going to be intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism cooperation. And there are going to be specialized areas where we can provide logistical support and training and enabling support.But the fact is, is that unless Afghan soldiers and Afghan police are able to maintain security, at some point, someday, the United States and other coalition forces would leave. And the good news is, what we've seen as we've removed ourselves from combat roles is the Afghan security forces have stepped up. And although they're certainly not as well equipped as coalition forces, they're better equipped than the Taliban. They're better equipped than the Haqqani network.And so with the kind of leadership that President Ghani is showing as a Commander in Chief, with the leadership that's being shown by a growing cadre of military officers up and down the military chain, Afghan forces are proving themselves and discovering that, in fact, when they fight, they can be successful. And we want to stand with them in that process because we are very much invested in your success.So, Mr. President, thank you for an outstanding visit. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.\n",

            "That's a lot of questions there, Jim. Do the Italian journalists, by the way, do this, these sort of five-part questions? Same thing? I can't say about Italian journalism. The, all right, let me try to remember this. In terms of the meeting with His Holiness Pope Francis, we had a wide-ranging discussion. I would say that the largest bulk of the time was discussing two central concerns of his. One is the issues of the poor, the marginalized, those without opportunity, and growing inequality.And those of us as politicians have the task of trying to come up with policies to address issues, but His Holiness has the capacity to open people's eyes and make sure they're seeing that this is an issue. And he's discussed in the past, I think, the dangers of indifference or cynicism when it comes to our ability to reach out to those less fortunate or those locked out of opportunity.And then we spent a lot of time talking about the challenges of conflict and how elusive peace is around the world. There was some specific focus on the Middle East, where His Holiness has a deep interest in the Israeli-Palestinian issue, but also what's happening in Syria, what's happening in Lebanon, and the potential persecution of Christians. And I reaffirmed that it is central to U.S. foreign policy that we protect the interests of religious minorities around the world.But we also touched on regions like Latin America, where there's been tremendous progress in many countries, but there's been less progress in others.I think what, the theme that stitched our conversation together was a belief that in politics and in life, the quality of empathy, the ability to stand in somebody else's shoes and to care for someone even if they don't look like you or talk like you or share your philosophy, that that's critical. It's the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars. It's the lack of empathy that allows us to ignore the homeless on the streets. And obviously, central to my Christian faith is a belief in treating others as they, I'd have them treat me. And what's, I think, created so much love and excitement for His Holiness has been that he seems to live this and shows that joy continuously.In terms of domestic issues, the two issues that we touched on, other than the fact that I invited and urged him to come visit the United States, telling him that people would be overjoyed to see him, was immigration reform. And as someone who came from Latin America, I think he was very mindful of the plight of so many immigrants who are wonderful people, working hard, making contributions, many of their children are U.S. citizens, and yet they still live in the shadows, in many cases have been deported, and are separated from families. I described to him how I felt that there was still an opportunity for us to make this right and get a law passed.And he actually did not touch, in detail, on the Affordable Care Act. In my Cardinal, in my meeting with his Secretary of State, Cardinal Parolin, we discussed briefly the issue of making sure that conscience and religious freedom was observed in the context of applying the law. And I explained to him that most religious organizations are entirely exempt. Religiously affiliated hospitals or universities or NGOs simply have to attest that they have a religious objection, in which case they are not required to provide contraception, although employees of theirs who choose are able to obtain it through the insurance company.And I pledged to continue to dialogue with the U.S. Conference of Bishops to make sure that we can strike the right balance, making sure that not only everybody has health care, but families, and women in particular, are able to enjoy the kind of health care coverage that the ACA offers, but that religious freedom is still observed.\n",

            "So, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I haven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will, there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce, nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces. Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people. And tht's exctly the essge tht hs been sent. President ung. Let e respond to this question concerning the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting trnsltio Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Cn you her, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I' sure tht he ws sying soething very wise nd iportnt, nd we wnted to ke sure tht we ll herd it. President ung. So I would like to dd tht Vietn, together with other TPP countries, hve been king efforts to nrrow differences, to proote coopertion in the spirit of utul understnding nd utul respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness nd understnding nd pying ttention to one nother's legitite interests. And the finliztion of TPP is lso the successful outcoes of ll 12 ebers of the TPP, rther thn ny individul effort. And we re prepred to rtify TPP, nd we stnd redy to ipleent ll the coitents under TPP.\n",

The American people have seen hundreds of billions of dollars spent already, and still the economy continues to free fall. Beyond avoiding the national catastrophe that you've warned about, once all the legs of your stool are in place, how can the American people gauge whether or not your programs are working? Can they--should they be looking at the metric of the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment? What metric should they use? When?
